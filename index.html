  <p>JAN 2019 – OCT 2019 <br>
 <b>Research Intern / NIZO Food Research, Ede, the Netherlands</b> <br>
 Conducting research on pea (Pisum sativum) seed proteins as a sustainable alternative to dairy proteins.
 The proteome of plant seed proteins was studied by means of HPLC-MS/MS and SDS-PAGE and a new
 method involving in-solution trypsin digestion was developed. Special emphasis was placed on the
 identification and understanding of post-translational modifications.<hr>
<p>
  SEP 2016 – MAR 2017 <br>
 <b>Research Intern / RIKILT Institute of Food Safety, Wageningen, the Netherlands</b> <br>
 Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was explored as a fast and easy screening method for the detection of
 adulteration in spices such as ground nutmeg with the handheld NIR spectrometer SCiO (Consumer
 Physics). A statistical classification model was developed and optimized to this end.

Chemicals (Deventer, The Netherlands)</b> <br>
Preliminary study for the design of miniaturised Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)
instrumentation for polymer characterization. Different solvent systems used in SEC were
catalogued and a literature study of possible compatible materials for microfluidic systems was
carried out.
